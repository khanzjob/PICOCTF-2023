## Description 

Someone might have hidden the password in the trace file.
Find the key to unlock this file. This tracefile might be good to analyze.

## Hints 

1. Download the pcap and look for the password or flag.
2. Don't try to use a password cracking tool, there are easier ways here.


## Solution 

Here we have a password protected zip file and a pcap file which probably contains the password. 

So again a pcap file and again there were codes like previous challenge "pcapPoisoning" . So I straight went up to use strings and found this

I used base64 to decode the string

Now initially I didn't find anything more... stuck for hours..trying to find rest of the  part of the flag... 

Then I noticed Hint 1 and my one friend suggested to use flag to find the flag... So I tried entering the decoded string and it worked ðŸ’¥
