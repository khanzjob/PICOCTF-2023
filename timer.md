## Description
You will find the flag after analysing this apk


## Solution 
 This is an apk file , so you can use a apk decompiler like "apktool" or if you will use ```file``` command on the apk , it will show it's zip, so you can directly unzip the apk. 
 
The AndroidManifest.xml file contains the flag so just cat it.
