## Description
How about some hide and seek heh?
Download this file and find the flag.

## Solution 

First I tried solving using Wireshark (obviouslyðŸ˜ª). There are some codes which on decrypting with base64 gives gibberish output. Then I just opened the pcap file with notepad
and searche for "pico" and boom got the flag.
